# Galactic Guardian

Open source Cocos2D/SpriteBuilder twin stick shooter.

## Building:

To check out the project run the following command. The "recursive" flag is quite important since it has Cocos as a submodule. (and that has submodules of it's own...)

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/slembcke/GalacticGuardian.spritebuilder.git`

Next, you'll need to open the SpriteBuilder project and publish the assets. I used the 1.3 version to make the game. I have no idea if SpriteBuilder 1.2 will work, though I don't think I'm using any of the new editor features.
